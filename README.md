# bovreg-twas-suite
bovreg-twas-suite is a modular Nextflow pipeline suite for performing transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in cattle. It includes workflows to generate imputed genotypes and expression inputs from RNA-seq data for model training, and to run TWAS using trained models to map trait-associated genes.
